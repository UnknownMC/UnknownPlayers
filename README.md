UnknownPlayers
==============

**UnknownPlayers** is a Bukkit plugin originally developed for [UnknownMC](http://www.unknownmc.net/ "UnknownMC - Survival the way you like it"). It keeps track of the exact time a player has spent on the Minecraft server and, if enabled, promotes them to a certain group after a while ("New -> "Player"). It also offers several other group-related options.

UnknownPlayers currently uses flatfile YAML storage but a rewrite is planned to use a MySQL database (YAML will likely remain an option). It is licensed under the GNU General Public License, meaning anybody is free to modify the code to their liking. If you're a developer as well, you're welcome to fork the repository on GitHub. If you add new features that may be useful for other users of the plugin, we'd appreciate a pull request as well.

If you have any questions about this project, I'm usually on IRC: irc.spi.gt #unknownmc.
