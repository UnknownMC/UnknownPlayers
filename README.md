UnknownPlayers
==============

**UnknownPlayers** is a Bukkit plugin originally developed for [UnknownMC](http://www.unknownmc.net/ "UnknownMC - Survival the way you like it"). It keeps track of the exact time a player has spent on the Minecraft server and, if enabled, promotes them to a certain group after a while ("New -> "Player"). It also offers several other group-related options.

UnknownPlayers currently uses flatfile YAML storage and is updated for UUID-based system (ready for name changes :D). It is licensed under the GNU General Public License, meaning anybody is free to modify the code to their liking. If you're a developer as well, you're welcome to fork the repository on Bitbucket. If you add new features that may be useful for other users of the plugin, we'd appreciate a pull request as well.

Downloading UnknownPlayers
=========================
You can download UnknownPlayers from [here](downloads).

The latest version is currently **UnknownPlayers 2.0**. It was compiled with **Bukkit 1.7.8-R0.1** (build #1922) and tested with **Spigot #1423**. This plugin is provided without any warranty whatsoever and may break at any time, regardless of the version of Spigot/CraftBukkit/... used.

If you have any questions about this project, I'm usually on IRC: irc.spi.gt #unknownmc.
